        The rules are easy: We got <u>10 questions</u> for you to find out if
        you know how to talk to the human beings around you. Each question also
        comes with a brief explanation why something might be problematic to
        say, so hopefully you'll learn something new.

        But most of all: Have fun and be nice to people ðŸ§¡
