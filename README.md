# Language is a powerful tool
This small quiz app was created during the first 2021 hackathon at Novatec. We want to grow awareness, that everything you say has an impact on others in the way what you say or how you say it even if you mean no harm. The idea is to create a small quiz where a person can check how he or she perceives certain phrases or how they could be perceived. The solution to a negative example contains an explanation why the usage of certain words, phrases or stereotypes might be perceived negatively. This topic emerged during a discussion about a CoC which is part of the topics at Women@NT

# Rules
There is a set of questions which can be answered with yes or no. The explanation should help to understand the issue with some sentences

But most important: Have fun and be nice to people ðŸ§¡
